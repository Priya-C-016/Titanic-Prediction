# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using structured machine learning techniques in Python. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, and port of embarkation.


## 🧠 Objective

To build a classification model that:

- Preprocesses real-world Titanic passenger data
- Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict survival
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall
- Accepts custom passenger input for real-time predictions
